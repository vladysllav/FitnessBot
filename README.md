## Installation

* You must have an SSH key generated before executing the commands

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:vladysllav/FitnessBot.git
   ```

   because of the firewall settings, the command may not work, then we use

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/vladysllav/FitnessBot.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using Poetry:
  *Check if Poetry is installed

   ```shell
   poetry --version
   ```

   if installed, execute

   ```shell
   cd FitnessBot/src/ poerty install
   ```

   if not installed, execute

   ```shell
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python -
   ```

   then add poerty to the PATH variable

Copy the path to the folder with the installed poetry. It is listed in the installation output and looks something like this:
C:\Users\273C~1\AppData\Roaming\Python\Scripts # example (You will have a different address)
Open the Control Panel and go to "System" (System) > "Advanced system settings" (Advanced system settings).
Click on the "Environment Variables..." button.
In the "User variables for [your username]" section, find the "Path" variable and select it.
Click on the "Edit..." button.
In the Edit Environment Variable window, click the New button.
Paste the copied path to the folder with the installed poetry and click "OK".
Click "OK" in all windows to save changes.
You should now be able to use poetry from any folder on the command line.
Try running:

   ```shell
   poetry --version
   ``` 

   and 

   ```shell
   cd FitnessBot/src/ poerty install
   ``` 

3. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file:
